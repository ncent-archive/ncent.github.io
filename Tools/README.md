## Telegram Bot

Bot used for Telegram messaging app. Primary purpose is data collection to assist with business and marketing procedures and public relations. It collects information on who invites whom to the nCent chatrooms so that we can have contests such as the logo design contest, where we recursively assign points to the inviters of the winners. It also forwards tweets from KK's Twitter feed to the telegram chatrooms.
