### 1. JobCent
#### Problem
The labor market is disjointed-- there are people looking for jobs and can’t find them. There are also companies who are unable to find the employees they need. If we remove the inefficiency of the current labor market, we can help employees and companies find each other through referral chains and even decrease unemployment.

#### Why JobCent
jobCent is the nCent Labs incentive protocol that incentivizes people to find a potential candidate to join the nCent Labs workspace. jobCent encourages people to refer the most qualified candidates by rewarding
everyone involved in referral upon the hire of a candidate. It's a win-win situation: better candidates, faster hires, and bonuses for those who take part in finding our ideal employee.

#### Existing Institutions We Want to Disrupt
Angellist, Linkedin, Headhunting Agencies

### 2. DevCent
#### Problem
Companies need to find talented developers to hire but it is a long and hard process to find these developers and to find the best ones.

#### Why DevCent
DevCent helps you use the power of your network by recursive incentives to unlock and find the most talented developers in the fastest possible way.

### 3. DateCent
#### Problem
When single, most people desire romantic partners. Finding partners and meeting new people can be a very difficult task for one person to perform alone. Many have therefore turned to applications which either employ algorithms simply ask the user to filter nearby matches. However, often people have most success when simply referred by friends who they trust to know them better than the best algorithms; the limitation being the difficulty of incentivizing friends to perform the referral. DateCent provides incentives for referral of romantic partners to allow the search for romantic partners to become as efficient and effective as possible.

#### Why DateCent will Disrupt the Dating World
Applications which use algorithms like Match.com or apply broad categorical or user-initiated filters such as Tinder to locate romantic partners. These methods of finding romantic partners are inefficient due to their separation from the user. Instead DateCent targets the underutilized referral system from those who the user trusts, providing incentives those who refer efficiently utilizing the power of a user’s vast network and outperforming less efficient filtering platforms.

### 4. SportCent
#### Problem
Sports teams are not only trying to win games - they are also businesses focused on sustaining profits each season. Professional sports teams are one of the unique business types that can really utilize strong brand loyalty among their fan bases, and as such, the room for better incentive markets to emerge is enormous.

#### Why SportCent
SportCent gives professional sports teams and their fan bases an opportunity to share merchandise sales revenue. Other ideas we have for SportCent include attendance referrals. This will allow a sports team to become far more popular by incentivizing referral at a small cost to their sales revenue.

#### Existing Institutions We Want to Disrupt
Ticketing, Merchandise Sales, etc.

### 5. SongCent
#### Problem
With the recent surge of music streaming and the newest trends in revenue sharing, musicians depend more than ever on popularity to be successful in their careers. Right now, popularity is determined in the music industry by certain long-standing means of exposure such as the radio, advertisements, and more. Social media has turned out to have a huge role in the sharing of music between fans, but there are still many potential "shares" to be had for aspiring artists looking for their work to go viral.

#### Why SongCent
Free applications such as SoundCloud have demonstrated how hungry artists are just to get exposure to their music, but while a platform for aspiring artists is great, there is still a piece missing in the way of fanbase accumulation. SongCent is an ambitious project that aims to redefine the concept of royalties in its entirety. Rather than all profits for each "listen" of a song going to record labels and streaming services (with a small share going to the artists themselves), SongCent aims to attribute value to the fans responsible for giving a platform to the artists they love by rewarding them for successfully sharing music with other prospective fans via successful listens to shared content.

#### Existing Institutions we want to Disrupt
Record Labels, Streaming Services and other Music Delivery Institutions, Music Sharing Applications such as Spotify, Pandora, etc.

### 6. FanCent
#### Problem
Some brands/artists/products take a long time to find the right crowd for them. The system of connecting people to products/ art that they like is inefficient. We could use information that people already know about each other to expand the networks of brands/products.

#### Why FanCent
FanCent is the nCent Labs incentive protocol that incentivizes people to find and engage fans for your product. Your fans have large networks, connect with them and build a larger following.

### 7. BuildCent
#### Problem
When building a product, workers may be incentivized to take complete ownership of a task that could be more efficiently solved by other people handling certain subtasks.

#### Why BuildCent
BuildCent is an incentive protocol that incentivizes workers to collaborate on building a product. BuildCent aims to incentivize workers to delegate tasks to coworkers who are most suited for solving that specific problem

#### Existing Institutions we want to Disrupt
Building contractors

### 8. LearnCent
#### Problem
Students across education levels are more motivated to teach themselves and do better than their peers than to help teach their peers.

#### Why LearnCent
LearnCent aims to incentivize students to help and teach each other. If student A teaches student B and student B’s test scores improve by a certain amount, A could get some fraction of B’s gains in extra credit.

### 9. GiveCent
#### Problem
Charities need to reach out to more potential donors.

#### Why GiveCent
With GiveCent, people are incentivized to refer and spread information to friends who will be likely to donate to some charity. Incentives can be in the form of karma points.

### 10. GameCent
#### Problem
Gaming is trending further toward multiplayer every year, especially with the rise of games like PUBG and Fortnite. Unfortunately, games like these can be discouraging for potential fans who have a harder time being able to “party up”.

#### Why GameCent
GameCent solves those problems by aiming to incentivize multiplayer gaming. Referring your friends for bonus points, loot, and "XP" is not a new concept, but GameCent is looking to take it to the next level. Hard to coordinate with new people you just met alone? GameCent can incentive teamwork by aligning team rewards.    

#### Existing Institutions we are looking to Disrupt
Xbox Live, Playstation Network, Steam, and more
